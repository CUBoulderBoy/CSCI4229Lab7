Lab 7: X-Wing with Lighting and Textures

Christopher Jordan
CSCI4229 Fall 2014

Utilizing code provided from William Schreuder via the ex9 and ex13 programs

Approximate time: 30 hours

Notes:
This is a work in progress and an attempt to make progress towards our
final project. I still intend to add a lot more detail to the x-wing fighter.
However, as I built this from the ground up for this lab, time limited my
ability to add details while learning textures and ensuring the appropriate
normal vectors for all planes on the fighter.

There are also textures here that are not utilized. I have kept them since
I might use them in future iterations of this code.
